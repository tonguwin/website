        I'm a self-taught front-end designer and developer who enjoys creating
        modern designs with Tailwind CSS. I have customers worldwide and have
        had successful projects. Recently, two of my projects were acquired, and
        I'm currently working on Lexington Themes. I also curate Colors &amp;
        Fonts and create VS Code Themes.
